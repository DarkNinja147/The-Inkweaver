A determined slugcat, raised by scavengers, must find a new home for his colony.
Perhaps you know a suitable place?

This mod includes a slugcat named Inkweaver, my primary and only slugcat OC. Unique things:
- He is supposed to have a mask similar to the Chieftain's mask, but not as grandiose and can be hard-equipped like Moon's cloak
- He is supposed to be able to carry two spears on his back and three small one-handed objects on a strap around the base of his tail, you can use the SPECIAL keybind to select which slot to put/retrieve the items from.
- He currently has a build-in DMS skin that uses Auto's Curated Slugcats as a base
- He starts by leaving Metropolis
- He has a Citizen ID Drone (it can't be used to unlock metropolis again because I'm not sure how to resync it currently)
- There are two "ending checkpoints" to reach before getting one of the two story endings, not counting the ascension ending:
    - First when you reach Outer Expanse by using your Citizen ID Drone to force-open the gate
    - Second when you get back to Metropolis, also by force-reopening the gate
-  After reaching both of these points in order, you can now go back to the Chieftain to find Artificer just arriving to kill him (I'm not very sure how complicated this would be). There are now two outcomes that lead to their own story endings:
    - Chieftain dies, leading to the "resentment" ending
    - Artificer dies, leading to the "migration" ending (You found a new place to live in Outer Expanse, yippee, now everyone has to move there o.o)
This mod is currently going to stay extremely unfinished, as I don't know how to code C#. But here's a general TODO in no particular order:
- Get art (no menu/sleep/death/starve/icons currently. I can't make art worth a single penny, nor can I buy art at the current point in time)
- Create mask item
- Extra item slots
- Campaign goal triggers
- 5P dialogue (LttM is collapsed because it's Arti's spot on the timeline)
- Cutscenes? Maybe?
- Figure out a way to force-save after exiting GATE_UW_LC at the start of campaign so as to avoid the bug with the echo on top of the Wall
