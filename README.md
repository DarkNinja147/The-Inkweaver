A determined slugcat, raised by scavengers, must find a new home for himself.

Perhaps you know a suitable place?

6.24.2025 Lore has been massively improved, and both endings are completely different.

6.25.2025 ART!!! YAYY

This mod includes a slugcat named Inkweaver, my primary and only slugcat OC. Unique things:
- He is supposed to have a mask similar to the Chieftain's mask, but not as grandiose and can be hard-equipped like Moon's cloak (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
- He is supposed to be able to carry two spears on his back and three small one-handed objects on a strap around the base of his tail, you can use the SPECIAL keybind to select which slot to put/retrieve the items from. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
- He currently has a build-in DMS skin that uses Auto's Curated Slugcats as a base (recommended tail size: 5 length, 2.5 wideness, 0.1 roundness)
- He starts by leaving Metropolis
- He has a Citizen ID Drone
- There are two endings, one must be achieved after the other: (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
    - First when you reach Outer Expanse by using your Citizen ID Drone to force-open the gate. Make it to Journey's End. Pre-incident Artificer should be there. The lore has been updated for this, check the AO3 work.
    - Second when you get back to the Metropolis gate, where you meet post-incident Arti about to go through and convince her to stop with her revenge plot, because, yay, Ink and Arti are mates. Again, the lore has been finally adjusted to make this work right. The save will lock after this.
This mod is currently going to stay extremely unfinished, as I don't know how to code C#. But here's a general TODO in no particular order:
- Create ending triggers and cutscenes
- Create mask item
- Extra item slots
- Fix 5P dialogue, maybe add more (LttM is collapsed because it's Arti's spot on the timeline)
- Figure out a way to force-save after exiting GATE_UW_LC at the start of campaign so as to avoid the bug with the echo on top of the Wall

I don't understand how people can't just credit their contributors. It's not like you're going to lose any traffic by doing so, they still have to go through your work to see the credits. Anyway. Thank you SO MUCH Urarun/Bush for the art!!

So, turns out Peter can't at all understand how I felt throughout the whole drama and won't accept me groveling once again, so I'll just leave this carrd here to show how I felt going through everything. (I also moved the entire really chunky wall of text into it so as to not bloat this on my mod. You're welcome.) https://darkninja147-drama.carrd.co
